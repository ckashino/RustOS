# An 'operating system' made in Rust

## Introduction
A very high-level approach to creating a program capable of running on bare-metal x86 hardware. As it's my first time creating anything like this (or anything in Rust, really), 
I took advantage of various tutorials and tools to create the basis of the project (https://os.phil-opp.com/, https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootimage). Once the groundwork is 
made I plan to make it include very basic, board-based games such as tic-tac-toe and connect-4 for starters.

The program can be ran using the .bin file with a x86_64 emulator (like qemu), or on actual hardware.

## Todo

- [x] Basic ground-work (printing, etc)
- [ ] Add gifs of program to repo
- [ ] Tic-tac-toe
